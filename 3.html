<br>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
<br>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
